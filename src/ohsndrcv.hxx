/** 
 * This implements a special mode of operation for upmpdcli where a
 * Songcast Sender is created (playing the current playlist) and we
 * switch to Receiver mode. Other Receivers may then be connected for
 * synchronized multiroom playing.
 *
 * On entering the mode, the following operations are performed.
 *  - Tell MPD to stop playing.
 *  - Start another MPD process which one FIFO output.
 *  - Start a Songcast Sender (uxsender) process, playing from the
 *    FIFO. 
 *  - (The two above steps are implement by an external script)
 *  - Copy the playlist to the new MPD, and play approximately from
 *    where we stopped.
 *  - Switch to receiver mode and play from the just created Sender.
 * At this point other Receivers may be connected.
 *
 * The mode is entered by selecting the SenderReceiver source in
 * OHProduct::setSource. This is a slight abuse of the function, but
 * allows controlling this from any CP implementing setSource.
