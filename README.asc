=== upmpdcli: an UPnP front-end to the Music Player Daemon

*upmpdcli* implements an *UPnP* _Media Renderer_, using *MPD* to perform
the real work.

It has been tested with a number of *UPnP* control points running on
*Android* and *Windows*. Because of their good support of *OpenHome*
_Playlists_, which are a significant improvement over bare *UPnP*, and
their general quality, *Bubble UPnP* (*Android* app) and Upplay (*Linux* and 
*Windows*) work best with it.

==== How things work: 

The Control Points uses the *UPnP* protocols to browse the tracks on the
_Media Server_ and choses URIs to be played. It then talks *UPnP* to *umpdcli*,
which uses the *MPD* client protocol to place the URIs into the *MPD*
playlist. *MPD* finally retrieves the data from the _Media Server_ using HTTP.

            V                  V

Each of the _Control point_, _Media Server_, *MPD* and *upmpdcli* processes
can run on any network host.
